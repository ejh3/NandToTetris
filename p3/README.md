Due Date: Thursday, October 20th, 2022 at 11:59pm

**The full specification for this project can be found online at [https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse390b/22au/projects/project3.html](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse390b/22au/projects/project3.html)**

### Instructions
Navigate to the Project 3 assignment on Canvas (linked [here](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1605861/assignments/7759978)). Download the document template titled `Project 3.docx`. Open the document, read the instructions on the first page, and estimate the amount of time you think it will take you to complete this project. Then, complete Parts I, II, and III of the project (in that specified order).

### Part I: 24-Hour Time Audit (10 points)
- Complete the 24-hour time audit and reflection activities according to the instructions in the specification linked above.

### Part II: Boolean Arithmetic (15 points)
- Complete the following files (in order) to implement each chip:
  - `HalfAdder.hdl`
  - `FullAdder.hdl`
  - `Add16.hdl`
  - `ALU.hdl` (the specification recommends three stages of implementation)

### Part III: Project 3 Reflection (5 points)
- Estimate how long it will take you to complete Project 3 on the last page of the `Project 3.docx` document. Keep track of the amount of time you spent completing this project.
- Answer the Project 3 reflection questions on the last page of the document.

## Submitting Your Work
Submit Part II by tagging your latest commit as `project-3` and pushing the tag to GitLab:
- `git tag project-3`
- `git push --tags`

Once you have completed the `Project 3.docx` document (Parts I & III), submit the document as a PDF on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/451576) under the assignment named “Project 3: 24-Hour Time Audit & Boolean Arithmetic.”
